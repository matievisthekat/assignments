The Shooting of Dan McGrew

A bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute saloon;
The kid that handles the music-box was hitting a jag-time tune;
Back of the bar, in a solo game, sat Dangerous Dan McGrew,
And watching his luck was his light-o'-love, the lady that's known as Lou.

When out of the night, which was fifty below, and into the din and the glare,
There stumbled a miner fresh from the creeks, dog-dirty, and loaded for bear.
He looked like a man with a foot in the grave
   and scarcely the strength of a louse,
Yet he tilted a poke of dust on the bar,
   and he called for drinks for the house.
There was none could place the stranger's face,
   though we searched ourselves for a clue;
But we drank his health, and the last to drink was Dangerous Dan McGrew.
